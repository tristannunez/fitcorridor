Description:
This code accompanies the article "A statistical framework for predicting migration corridors" by NuÃ±ez, T., Hurley, M., Graves, T. Ortega, A. Sawyer, H., Fattebert, J., Merkle, J., and Kauffman, M., accepted for publication in the journal Methods in Ecology and Evolution. 

This project contains the R functions used in fitting cost-distance models to the migration movement tracks used in the manuscript. In addition, it contains a vignette that illustrates the model fitting process. 

Begin by reading the Rmarkdown vignette HTML file (fitcorridor_rmarkdown_vignette.html), and then run the code in fitcorridor_vignette.R. 

Prerequisites: 
The code requires the following R packages: gdistance, parallel, rgdal, ggplot2, ggspatial, and rgeos.
