Description:
This code accompanies the article "A statistical framework for predicting migration corridors" by Nuñez, T., Hurley, M., Graves, T. Ortega, A. Sawyer, H., Fattebert, J., Merkle, J., and Kauffman, M., accepted for publication in the journal Methods in Ecology and Evolution. 

This project contains the R functions used in fitting cost-distance models to the migration movement tracks used in the manuscript. In addition, it contains a vignette that illustrates the model fitting process. 

Begin by reading the Rmarkdown vignette HTML file (fitcorridor_rmarkdown_vignette.html), and then run the code in fitcorridor_vignette.R. 

Prerequisites: 
The code requires the following R packages: gdistance, parallel, rgdal, ggplot2, ggspatial, and rgeos.
